A commandline utility that can be used to decrypt Wii U NUS content files.

This is a fork of https://code.google.com/p/cdecrypt intended for modders,
who want to explore or modify the content of the Wii U applications they own.

Unlike other clones, this version of cdecrypt has **no** external dependencies
such as OpenSSL libraries and whatnot. A single executable file is all you need.
